This is currently post-poned for later, I must first learn most of the Programming and Graphics Basics before going further as I will have lots of issues with Code Quality and they way things were going to be Structured, I will first make some small projects that aren't too difficult to do and have better plans for which things must be like and which tools will be required, and physics could be my top priority for this game because it seems to be helalalowlowoat difficult to implement it the way I want it, maybe otherwise with some experience later on.

# MemreClub

This Project is under heavy development, Inspired by Midnight Club 3

The Goal of this project is to learn and understand a lot of techniques that I always wondered how they were done as a kid, making almost everything from scratch

I have no idea when this will be finished, most likely never, But hey! at least understanding stuff Is what I care about

Resources currently learning from:
