# MemreClub
A Massive Project That is under heavy development, trying to replicate Midnight Club 3 from scratch

The Goal of this project is to learn and understand many techniques that I always wondered how they were done as a kid

But instead of using something like Unity or Unreal engine on my poor machine (And they are still useful for creating Concepts and learning Game Design), I'm going to make almost everything from scratch
